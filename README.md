## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior scientist at the Chair of Applied Physics at Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg. My field is solid-state physics with a focus on semiconductor physics. I'm also a little bit into software development. Our major project is [NOMAD CAMELS](https://github.com/FAU-LAP/NOMAD-CAMELS).
